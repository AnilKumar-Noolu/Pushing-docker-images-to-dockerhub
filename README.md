# Pushing-docker-images-to-dockerhub

In this Repo, we will be pushing the Docker Images to dockerhub by using Jenkins in Declarative approach.
The only thing we needed here is an EC2 Instance created with Docker and Git installed in it.
And then we can pull docker images or build docker images using Dockerfile and can push them to dockerhub by using Jenkins Pipeline Job.
